# React Frontend

## About this app
This was Version 1.0 of the ReactJS front end web site for www.wfhuniv.com, before it was rebranded as www.elisabethsteele.com. The published site at www.elisabethsteele.com is currently a WordPress site, which as also built by me at Studio Ten Four (www.studiotenfour.com).

For the React project, I learned and used a few technologies, such as:
1. ReactJS
2. Parcel - A fast, zero configuration web application bundler (https://parceljs.org)
3. TailwindCSS - A utility-first CSS framework (https://tailwindcss.com/)
4. Netlify - For CI/CD and hosting

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

`yarn start` starts a local dev server

### `yarn build`

`yarn build` compiles the application for deployment to production

### `netlify deploy --prod`


`netlify deploy --prod` deploys the compiled app to production

**You need to run this command before starting your project**
