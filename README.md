# React Frontend

## About this app
This was Version 1.0 of the ReactJS frontend for Work from Home University, LLC. Check out the Staging site here: https://wfhu-frontend-prod.studiotenfour.biz/

Work from Home University, LLC was recently rebranded as Elisabeth Steele, LLC. Their current website at www.elisabethsteele.com is a WordPress site, which as also built by me at Studio Ten Four (www.studiotenfour.com).

For the React project, I learned and used a few technologies, such as:
1. ReactJS - A component-based javascript UI framework (https://reactjs.org)
2. Parcel - A fast, zero configuration web application bundler (https://parceljs.org)
3. TailwindCSS - A utility-first CSS framework (https://tailwindcss.com)
4. Netlify - For CI/CD and hosting (https://www.netlify.com)
5. GraphQL - For making api calls to the backend app (https://www.apollographql.com)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

`yarn start` starts a local dev server

### `yarn build`

`yarn build` compiles the application for deployment to production

### `netlify deploy --prod`


`netlify deploy --prod` deploys the compiled app to production

**You need to run this command before starting your project**
